- Put your PuTTY server SSH key inside the /Backup/ folder. NOT your GPG private key! that one you MUST keep a secret.

- If you don't have a SSH server key, used for SSH and SCP copy access, you can create one with puttygen.exe

- It is recommeneded to have a SSH server key, and not SSH password access. (disable that on your server)
